# Passkey Demo Site
This project implements basic passkey functionality using Yubico's python fido2 library found [here](https://github.com/Yubico/python-fido2). The frontend is built in React and the backend serves files with Flask. Build it with `npm install && npm run build` from inside the frontend directory.
